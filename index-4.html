          <h2>Design challenge: Playdate App Concept</h2>
          <h3>A Safe and Fun Way to Make Playdates</h3>
          <p> This concept focused on developing an intuitive app that empowers children to initiate and manage 
            their own playdates‚Äîunder light parental guidance. Based on Think Aloud tests the goal was to encourage 
            kids‚Äô independence and planning skills in a safe and manageable way.
            A low-fidelity prototype was developed with large icons, visual cues, and optional avatars. 
            Parents could approve requests and, if needed, offer to host or help with transportation. The goal was to keep the parent's role clear but limited.
            The project focused on core functionality and served as a practical exercise in basic user-centred design and prototyping.

          <h3>Logo concept development</h3>
          <p>This fictional assignment was about finding the right visual expression for a club combining 
            football and hockey. The focus was on choosing a font and defining a tone of voice that could 
            support both sports ‚Äì something active, clear, and accessible without feeling too loud or playful.
            I explored how typography and language could reflect team spirit and structure, while staying functional 
            across digital platforms.</p>

            Client-Based Redesign with UX Evaluation, Testing & Live Pitch
          </h3>
          <p>
            This project involved the improvement of an existing website through
            a structured UX evaluation. A heuristic analysis and user testing
            identified key usability issues, which were translated into clear,
            actionable design improvements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final result was a high-fidelity prototype developed in Figma,
            including a redesigned landing page and selected subpages optimized
            for user experience. All findings and design decisions were
            documented in a professional client report, supported by a short
            promotional video. The project concluded with a live pitch to
            present the concept and rationale to stakeholders.

          <h3>From Research to Prototype - An Iterative UX Process</h3>
          <p>
            As part of a client collaboration with √òkolariet, this concept was
            developed to support the exhibition ‚ÄúDen Gr√∏nne Trepart‚Äù <em>(The Green
            Tripartite)</em>. The goal was to transform complex political and
            environmental themes into an interactive digital experience aimed at
            younger audiences. The concept focused on engagement, gamification,
            and simplified storytelling to make the climate crisis and
            sustainability policy more accessible. A high-fidelity prototype was
            designed in Figma, presenting a playful yet informative journey
            through key decisions shaping Denmark¬¥s green transition.

            Rapid Delivery Concept Based on User Research & Design Challenge

          <p>
           This project explored how to solve the everyday challenge of running out of essential items‚Äîlike milk‚Äîwhen time is tight. The goal was to design a fast and convenient last-minute shopping solution.
          Based on user interviews, surveys, and persona development, the concept evolved into a mobile app called FLUKS. It offers ultra-fast local delivery of small, urgent grocery items. The outcome was a hi-fi prototype focused on UX simplicity, speed, and relevance, developed through iterative testing and feedback.

          <p> This concept focused on developing an intuitive and secure app that empowers children to initiate and manage their own playdates‚Äîunder light parental guidance. Inspired by challenges shared by parents during user interviews, the goal was to support children‚Äôs independence, communication, and social skills in a digital format.
The app includes a kid-friendly interface with visual cues, customizable avatars, and voice-supported navigation. Parents have access to a supervision panel to approve or manage connections and schedules. The design process included co-creation workshops with children, low-fi prototyping, and iterative usability testing to ensure accessibility and engagement.
The final prototype balances simplicity, safety, and fun‚Äîpromoting real-world interaction through digital empowerment.
