  <h2>About me</h2>Hi, I’m Lotte – a multimedia design student passionate about visual 
  storytelling, structure, and user-friendly design. I explore the creative space between 
  aesthetics and code, always with curiosity and a strong concept. This portfolio is part of my 
  learning journey – hand-coded and built with care.

  I’m a multimedia design student with a focus on modern visual communication, UX, and responsive 
  web design. I approach projects using design thinking and enjoy building user-friendly, aesthetic 
  solutions through hands-on experimentation.
My portfolio is a reflection of my learning process – combining technical skills with a strong sense 
of design and structure. I value clarity, curiosity, and creativity in every project.

          <h3>
            Client-Based Redesign with UX Evaluation, Testing & Live Pitch
          </h3>
          <p>
            This project involved the improvement of an existing website through
            a structured UX evaluation. A heuristic analysis and user testing
            identified key usability issues, which were translated into clear,
            actionable design improvements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The final result was a high-fidelity prototype developed in Figma,
            including a redesigned landing page and selected subpages optimized
            for user experience. All findings and design decisions were
            documented in a professional client report, supported by a short
            promotional video. The project concluded with a live pitch to
            present the concept and rationale to stakeholders.

            As part of a client collaboration with Økolariet, this concept was
            developed to support the exhibition “Den Grønne Trepart”
            <em>(The Green Tripartite)</em>. The goal was to transform complex
            political and environmental themes into an interactive digital
            experience aimed at younger audiences. A high-fidelity prototype was
            designed in Figma, presenting a playful yet informative journey
            through key decisions shaping Denmark´s green transition.

            Rapid Delivery Concept Based on User Research & Design Challenge
          </h3>
          <p>
            This project explored how to solve the everyday challenge of running
            out of essential items—like milk—when time is tight. The goal was to
            design a fast and convenient last-minute shopping solution. Based on
            user interviews, surveys, and persona development, the concept
            evolved into a mobile app called FLUKS. It offers ultra-fast local
            delivery of small, urgent grocery items. The outcome was a hi-fi
            prototype focused on UX simplicity, speed, and relevance, developed
            through iterative testing and feedback.

          <h2>Design challenge: Social Planning App for Kids</h2>
          <h3>A Safe and Fun Way to Make Playdates</h3>
          <p>
            This concept focused on developing an intuitive and secure app that
            empowers children to initiate and manage their own playdates—under
            light parental guidance. Inspired by challenges shared by parents
            during user interviews, the goal was to support children’s
            independence, communication, and social skills in a digital format.
            The app includes a kid-friendly interface with visual cues,
            customizable avatars, and voice-supported navigation. Parents have
            access to a supervision panel to approve or manage connections and
            schedules. The design process included co-creation workshops with
            children, low-fi prototyping, and iterative usability testing to
            ensure accessibility and engagement. The final prototype balances
            simplicity, safety, and fun—promoting real-world interaction through
            digital empowerment.

            This fictional assignment was about finding the right visual
            expression for a club combining football and hockey. The focus was
            on choosing a font and defining a tone of voice that could support
            both sports – something active, clear, and accessible without
            feeling too loud or playful. I explored how typography and language
            could reflect team spirit and structure, while staying functional
            across digital platforms.
